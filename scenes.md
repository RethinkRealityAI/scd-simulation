### **Scene 1: EMS Handoff**
* **Prompt**: Select actions:
* **Options**:
    * A. Delay meds and observe
    * B. Begin focused assessment, establish IV, draw labs
    * C. Administer oral meds and discharge
* **Feedback**: Correct Answer: B. Early aggressive management of VOC is key. Delay can worsen outcomes and risk ACS.
* **Discussion Questions**:
    * What might the consequences of selecting A or C be?
    * How can implicit bias affect provider responses to Black youth presenting with pain?

***

### **Scene 2: Initial Assessment**
* **Prompt**: How do you respond to the parent?
* **Options**:
    * A. "We treat everyone the same."
    * B. "I understand your concern. We're taking his pain seriously."
    * C. "Letâ€™s wait and see if it gets worse."
* **Feedback**: Correct Answer: B. Cultural humility involves affirming parental concern and demonstrating commitment to pain relief.
* **Discussion Questions**:
    * Why might parents of children with SCD feel the need to advocate strongly?
    * How can providers reduce this burden?

***

### **Scene 3: Initial Management**
* **Prompt**: Choose initial interventions:
* **Options**:
    * Administer morphine IV within 30 minutes (0.1 mg/kg)
    * Start IV hydration (1.5x maintenance fluids)
    * Order CBC, retic count, CMP
    * Continuous pulse oximetry
* **Feedback**: Effective analgesia and hydration are the cornerstones of VOC management.

***

### **Scene 4: Team Communication**
* **Prompt**: Construct SBAR:
* **Options**:
    * **Situation**: 15-year-old with VOC
    * **Background**: HbSS, exertion-related pain onset
    * **Assessment**: 10/10 pain, stable vitals, no infection
    * **Recommendation**: Continue analgesia, monitor, escalate if pain persists
* **Feedback**: Clear interprofessional communication improves coordination and care efficiency.

***

### **Scene 5: Reassessment (30 minutes)**
* **Prompt**: Next action?
* **Options**:
    * Repeat opioid
    * Reassess labs
    * Consider consult to hematology
* **Feedback**: Persistent pain despite opioids requires reevaluation for ACS or complications.

***

### **Scene 6: Clinical Bias Challenge**
* **Prompt**: How do you respond?
* **Options**:
    * A. Ignore it
    * B. Address privately and reinforce SCD pain protocols
    * C. Agree silently
* **Feedback**: Correct Answer: B. Addressing bias is critical. Studies show SCD patients often face stigma and inadequate analgesia.
* **Discussion Questions**:
    * How can healthcare providers balance concerns around opioid prescribing with adequate pain treatment?
    * What do we know about the actual pain severity of VOCs?

***

### **Scene 7: Complication Risk**
* **Prompt**: What do you suspect?
* **Options**:
    * Acute Chest Syndrome
* **Prompt**: Select Orders:
* **Options**:
    * Chest X-ray
    * O2 via nasal cannula
    * Notify hematology
* **Feedback**: ACS is life-threatening. Early signs include desaturation and pain. Escalation is vital.

***

### **Scene 8: Admission Planning**
* **Prompt**: Select all that apply:
* **Options**:
    * Admit under pediatric hematology
    * Continue IV opioids and fluids
    * Monitor vitals and SpO2 continuously
    * Educate family on hydroxyurea compliance and stress reduction
