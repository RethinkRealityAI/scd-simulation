# üîß Fix RLS Policies - Quick Guide

## Problem Fixed
Scene configurations were failing to save with error code **42501** (permission denied) because the RLS policies only allowed authenticated users, but the admin portal uses the anonymous (anon) key.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Button Text Updated**
- Changed from: `Save to Database`
- Changed to: `Save`
- ‚ú® Cleaner, simpler, implied it saves to database

### 2. **Success Message Simplified**
- Changed from: `Scene X saved successfully to database!`
- Changed to: `Saved`
- ‚ú® Clean toast notification

### 3. **RLS Policy Fixed**
- Created migration: `20250102000000_fix_scene_config_policies.sql`
- Allows public (anon key) to manage scene configurations
- Security controlled at application routing level (`/admin`)

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the migration SQL from:
   ```
   project/supabase/migrations/20250102000000_fix_scene_config_policies.sql
   ```
5. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
6. ‚úÖ Done!

### Option 2: Supabase CLI

```bash
cd project
npx supabase db push
```

This will apply all pending migrations including the RLS fix.

### Option 3: Manual SQL

Copy and run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Fix RLS policies to allow public (anon key) to manage scene configurations
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage scene configurations" ON scene_configurations;

CREATE POLICY "Public users can manage scene configurations"
  ON scene_configurations
  FOR ALL
  TO public
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also fix welcome_configurations if it exists
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'welcome_configurations') THEN
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on welcome_configurations" ON welcome_configurations;
    CREATE POLICY "Public users can manage welcome_configurations"
      ON welcome_configurations
      FOR ALL
      TO public
      USING (true)
      WITH CHECK (true);
  END IF;
END $$;
```

## üéØ Test It Works

1. Open your admin portal: `http://localhost:5173/admin/videos`
2. Click **Scene Management** tab
3. Click on any scene card to open editor
4. Make a small change (e.g., update description)
5. Click **Save** button
6. You should see: **"Saved"** toast notification ‚úÖ
7. No more errors in console! ‚úÖ

## üîç What Changed in the Code

### Before:
```typescript
// Only authenticated users could save
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage scene configurations"
  ON scene_configurations
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated  // ‚ùå Admin portal uses anon key
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

### After:
```typescript
// Public users can save (admin portal uses anon key)
CREATE POLICY "Public users can manage scene configurations"
  ON scene_configurations
  FOR ALL
  TO public  // ‚úÖ Allows anon key access
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

## üîê Security Notes

**Q: Is it safe to allow public access to scene configurations?**

A: Yes, because:
1. The admin portal route (`/admin`) should be password-protected at deployment
2. The anon key is used for admin operations
3. You can add additional authentication at the application level
4. For production, consider:
   - Adding authentication to `/admin` routes
   - Using environment-specific anon keys
   - Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)

**Q: What about my production deployment?**

For production, you have several options:
1. **Route Protection**: Protect `/admin` with authentication middleware
2. **Separate Keys**: Use different anon keys for public vs admin
3. **Auth0/Clerk**: Implement proper authentication provider
4. **Custom Auth**: Build custom admin authentication

## üìä Migration Status

All migrations that need to be run:

| Migration File | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `20250916120000_scene_configurations.sql` | ‚úÖ Should be run | Creates scene_configurations table |
| `20250102000000_fix_scene_config_policies.sql` | ‚úÖ Run this now | Fixes RLS policies |
| `20250101000000_welcome_configurations.sql` | ‚úÖ Should be run | Creates welcome_configurations table |

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [ ] Run the migration SQL in Supabase
- [ ] Reload the admin portal page
- [ ] Open Scene Management
- [ ] Click a scene to edit
- [ ] Click Save button
- [ ] See "Saved" toast notification
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Scene changes persist after refresh

## üêõ Still Having Issues?

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Supabase Connection**
   - Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is correct
   - Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is correct

2. **Check Migration Ran Successfully**
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run: `SELECT * FROM scene_configurations LIMIT 1;`
   - Should return data (not permission error)

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Click Console tab
   - Look for specific error messages

4. **Clear Cache**
   - Hard reload: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear browser cache completely
