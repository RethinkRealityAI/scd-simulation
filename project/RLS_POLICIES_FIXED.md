# RLS Policies Fixed - Admin Dashboard Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The admin dashboard was unable to save or upload data because the RLS (Row Level Security) policies on `scene_configurations` and `welcome_configurations` tables were too restrictive. These tables only allowed **authenticated** users to perform INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, but the admin dashboard uses the **anon key** which has the **public** role.

## Solution Applied
Applied migration `fix_admin_rls_policies` that updated the RLS policies to allow public access for all operations on the admin-related tables.

## Current RLS Configuration

### Public Tables (Full Public Access)

#### 1. `simulation_videos`
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can read all records
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can create records
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update records
- ✅ **DELETE**: Public can delete records

#### 2. `scene_audio_files`
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can read all records
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can create records
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update records
- ✅ **DELETE**: Public can delete records

#### 3. `scene_characters`
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can read all records
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can create records
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update records
- ✅ **DELETE**: Public can delete records

#### 4. `scene_configurations` (FIXED)
- ✅ **ALL OPERATIONS**: Public can perform all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Previous Issue**: Only authenticated users could modify this table
- **Fix Applied**: Changed policy to allow public access

#### 5. `welcome_configurations` (FIXED)
- ✅ **ALL OPERATIONS**: Public can perform all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Previous Issue**: Only authenticated users could modify this table
- **Fix Applied**: Changed policy to allow public access

#### 6. `session_data`
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can read all records
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can create records
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update records
- ⚠️ **DELETE**: No explicit delete policy (not needed for typical use)

### Storage Buckets (All Public)

#### 1. `simulation-videos` Bucket
- ✅ **Public**: Yes
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can view files
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can upload files
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update files
- ✅ **DELETE**: Public can delete files

#### 2. `scene-audio-files` Bucket
- ✅ **Public**: Yes
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can view files
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can upload files
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update files
- ✅ **DELETE**: Public can delete files

#### 3. `character-avatars` Bucket
- ✅ **Public**: Yes
- ✅ **SELECT**: Public can view files
- ✅ **INSERT**: Public can upload files
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Public can update files
- ✅ **DELETE**: Public can delete files

## Security Advisors

### Current Warnings (Non-Critical)
1. **SECURITY_DEFINER_VIEW**: View `public.user_analytics` uses SECURITY DEFINER
   - This is intentional for analytics aggregation
   - Not blocking admin functionality

2. **FUNCTION_SEARCH_PATH_MUTABLE**: Two functions have mutable search paths
   - `update_session_data_updated_at`
   - `update_updated_at_column`
   - These are trigger functions and work correctly
   - Warnings are informational only

## Testing Checklist

Your admin dashboard should now be able to:

- ✅ Upload videos to storage buckets
- ✅ Create/update/delete video records in `simulation_videos`
- ✅ Upload audio files to storage
- ✅ Create/update/delete audio records in `scene_audio_files`
- ✅ Upload character avatars
- ✅ Create/update/delete character records in `scene_characters`
- ✅ Create/update scene configurations in `scene_configurations`
- ✅ Create/update welcome screen configs in `welcome_configurations`
- ✅ Read and create session data for analytics

## Migration Applied

```sql
-- Migration: fix_admin_rls_policies

-- Drop existing restrictive policies for scene_configurations
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage scene configurations" ON public.scene_configurations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read active scene configurations" ON public.scene_configurations;

-- Create new permissive policies for scene_configurations
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on scene_configurations"
  ON public.scene_configurations
  FOR ALL
  TO public
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Drop existing restrictive policies for welcome_configurations
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage welcome configurations" ON public.welcome_configurations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read welcome configurations" ON public.welcome_configurations;

-- Create new permissive policies for welcome_configurations
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on welcome_configurations"
  ON public.welcome_configurations
  FOR ALL
  TO public
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Admin Dashboard**: Try uploading videos, audio files, and saving configurations
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any remaining Supabase errors
3. **Verify Storage**: Confirm files are being saved to the correct buckets
4. **Check Database**: Verify records are being created/updated in the database

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security Consideration**: This configuration allows public access to admin functions. In a production environment with sensitive data, you should:
- Implement authentication for the admin dashboard
- Use the service role key for admin operations (server-side only)
- Or add row-level security based on admin user authentication

For now, this configuration is appropriate for your use case where the admin dashboard needs full access without authentication.
